# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in Python, along with test cases to verify their functionality.

## Files

- `test.py`: This script includes multiple sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort) and test cases to demonstrate their usage.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Selection Sort**: Divides the input into sorted and unsorted regions and iteratively selects the smallest element.

## Requirements

- Python

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kri04sna/Sorting.git
    cd Sorting
    ```

2. Run the test script:
    ```bash
    python test.py
    ```
